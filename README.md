# Gray Scale Image Processor

This is a simple image processor that can apply 12 filters (either one filter at a time or multiple ones) to any 256x256 gray-scale picture.

## These are the filters included:
1) Black and White Image 
2) Invert Image
3) Merge 2 Images
4) Flip Image
5) Rotate Image (90, 180, 270, or 360 degrees)
6) Darken and Lighten Image
7) Detect Image Edges
8) Enlarge Image (enlarge any quarter of an image)
9) Shrink Image (by a factor of 2, 3, or 4)
10) Mirror Image
11) Shuffle Image (any order of quarters)
12) Blur Image

- "Filters" folder has some gray scale images to experience with. (Make sure to include them and the bmplib.cpp & bmplib.h in the same directory of the source code file)
- The source code is "main.cpp" in Filters folder
- To see the 12 filters applied check the Results folder.
